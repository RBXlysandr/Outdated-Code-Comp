# Code-Comp
### A repository for a compilation of some of my codeworks

Some of the code I have is in projects I cannot access as they were temporary positions in other games (or under a mutual privacy agreement / NDA). However, here I was able to compile a bunch of things I made that I still have access too. 
I am an owner and sole creator of 2 games [Tower Defenders](https://www.roblox.com/games/2369647980/REVIVAL-UPDATE-TOWER-DEFENDERS) and [Hero Battles](https://www.roblox.com/games/10826246485/EARLY-ACCESS-HERO-BATTLES). Both of which are solely coded and developed by myself.
